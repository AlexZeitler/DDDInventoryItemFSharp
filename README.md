# An idiomatic F# implementation of Domain-Driven Design

- Blog post: [Domain-Driven Design With F# and EventStore](http://gorodinski.com/blog/2013/02/17/domain-driven-design-with-fsharp-and-eventstore/)

- Based on: [SimpleCQRS](https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r) by [Greg Young](http://goodenoughsoftware.net/)

- Uses EventStore for event persistance.

- To run the Xunit integration tests, start an instance of EventStore with the default settings.
